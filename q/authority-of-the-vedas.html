  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The Vedas are regarded as <em>śruti</em>—that which is "heard" or revealed.
    They form the foundational scripture in orthodox Hindu traditions and are
    considered timeless and authorless (<em>apauruṣeya</em>).
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Their authority comes from their antiquity, sanctity, and acceptance by
    successive generations of scholars and practitioners.
